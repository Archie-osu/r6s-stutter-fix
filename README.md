# Rainbow Six: Stutter Fix
Solves the issue of Ubisoft not managing threads properly leading to extreme stuttering.

The issue is that after one or two games, Rainbow Six Siege begins to stutter. This is fixed by reducing the active CPU count to 1, and resetting it back.

This program just automates that.
